[![Linux build status](https://travis-ci.org/gotham-rs/gotham.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gotham-rs/gotham)

A flexible web framework that does not sacrifice safety, security or speed.

The Gotham core team loves many of the elegant concepts that are found in dynamically typed web application frameworks, such as Rails, Phoenix and Django and aspire to achieve them with the type and memory safety guarantees provided by Rust.

Gotham is stability focused. All releases of Gotham are compatible with stable Rust and that contract will never change. To ensure we remain compatible, we also regularly build against beta and nightly Rust.

Gotham leverages async extensively thanks to the [Tokio project](https://tokio.rs) and is further enhanced by being built directly on top of async [Hyper](https://hyper.rs). Simple Gotham request handlers are able to complete in **Âµs** with very low memory requirements.
