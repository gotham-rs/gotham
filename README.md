## Features

1.  Stability focused. All releases target **stable**
    [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/). This will never
    change. To ensure future compatibility, we also run automated builds against
    Rust beta and nightly releases.
1.  Statically typed. The Gotham web framework is statically typed ensuring your
    application is **correctly expressed** at compile time.
1.  Async everything. By leveraging the [Tokio project](https://tokio.rs), all
    Gotham web framework types are async out of the box.  Our async story is
    further enhanced by [Hyper](https://hyper.rs), a fast server that provides
    an elegant layer over
    [stringly typed HTTP](http://wiki.c2.com/?StringlyTyped).
1.  Blazingly fast. Measure completed requests, including the 99th percentile,
    in **Âµs**.

We hope you'll find the Gotham web framework is flexible enough to meet the
needs of any web application you might like to build. Please
