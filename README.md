# Gotham

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/gotham-rs/gotham](https://badges.gitter.im/gotham-rs/gotham.svg)](https://gitter.im/gotham-rs/gotham?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Linux build status](https://travis-ci.org/gotham-rs/gotham.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gotham-rs/gotham)

A flexible web framework, written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) that promotes stability,
safety, security and speed.

## Features

1.  Stability focused. All releases target **stable** Rust. This will never change.
    To ensure future compatibility, we also run automated builds against Rust beta and
    nightly releases.
1.  Statically typed. Unlike other web frameworks Gotham is statically typed ensuring your
    entire application is **correctly expressed** at compile time.
1.  Async everything. By leveraging the [Tokio project](https://tokio.rs), all Gotham types are
    async out of the box.  Our async story is further enhanced by [Hyper](https://hyper.rs),
    a fast server that provides an elegant layer over stringly typed HTTP.
1.  Blazingly fast. Measure completed requests, including the 99th percentile, in **Âµs**.

## Alternatives

We hope you'll find Gotham is flexible enough to meet the needs of any web application you
might like to build. Please [have a chat with us](https://gitter.im/gotham-rs/gotham) or
[create an issue](https://github.com/gotham-rs/gotham/issues) if you find this isn't the case,
perhaps there is something Gotham can offer that will help you achieve your goals.

We do acknowledge that sometimes the choices we've made for Gotham may just not suit the needs of
all projects. If that is the case for your project there are alternative Rust web frameworks you
might like to consider:
