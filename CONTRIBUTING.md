## Pull requests

Pull requests that fix bugs, make improvements or add new features are very 
welcome, they are one of the main points of collaboration for the Gotham project. 

Pull requests should remain focused in scope and not contain unrelated commits.

**Please talk to us** before embarking on any significant pull request otherwise 
you risk spending a lot of time working on something that might not be a fit. 
IRC, email and issues are all good avenues to do this.

The Gotham project may use various bots and tools to automatically verify 
submitted pull requests. Ensure you address any errors these tools may report.

The Gotham core team may choose to **not** accept your contribution. 
When this happens we'll explain why and where possible make suggestions for how 
you might be able to achieve what you set out to with your pull request.
