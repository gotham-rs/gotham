## Pull requests

The core team appreciates pull requests that fix bugs, make improvements or add new features.
These are one of the main points of collaboration for the Gotham project.

Pull requests should remain focused in scope and not contain unrelated commits.

**Please talk to us** before embarking on any significant pull request otherwise you risk spending
a lot of time working on something that might not be a fit. Gitter and issues are good avenues
to do this.

The Gotham project may use automated tools to verify submitted pull requests.
Ensure you address any errors these tools may report.

The core team may choose to **not** accept your contribution.  When this happens we'll explain why
and where possible make suggestions for how you might be able to achieve what you set out to
with your pull request.
