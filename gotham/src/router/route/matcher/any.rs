/// the path to the current route). For example, this matcher is used when delegating a path prefix
/// to another router.

/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// # extern crate gotham;
/// # fn main() {
/// #   use gotham::state::State;
/// #   use gotham::router::route::matcher::{AnyRouteMatcher, RouteMatcher};
/// #
/// #   State::with_new(|state| {
/// #
///   let matcher = AnyRouteMatcher::new();
///
///   assert!(matcher.is_match(&state).is_ok());
/// #
/// #   });
/// # }
