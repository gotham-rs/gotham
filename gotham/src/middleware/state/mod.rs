//! State driven middleware to enable attachment of values to request state.
//!
//! This module provides generics to enable attaching (appropriate) values to
//! the state of a request, through the use of `Middleware`. Middleware can
//! be created via `StateMiddleware::with`, with the provided value being the
//! value to attach to the request state.

/// The generic types inside this struct can (and will) be cloned
/// often, so wrap your expensive types in reference counts as needed.
