//! Security based middleware to handle security based sanitizations.
//!
//! Prior to v0.3, this middleware was baked into responses by default. It has
//! now been separated to allow optional usage. You can attach as a middleware
//! at startup to include behaviour as was present before.
//!
//! Currently this middleware will set the following headers:
//!
//! - X-CONTENT-TYPE-OPTIONS: "nosniff"
//! - X-FRAME-OPTIONS: "DENY"
//! - X-XSS-PROTECTION: "1; mode=block"
//!
//! More may be added in future, but these headers provide compatibility with
//! previous versions of Gotham.
