//! Middlewares for the Gotham framework to log on requests made to the server.
//!
//! This module contains several logging implementations, with varying degrees
//! of complexity. The default `RequestLogger` will log out using the standard
//! [Common Log Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format) (CLF).
//!
//! There is also a `SimpleLogger` which emits only basic request logs.
