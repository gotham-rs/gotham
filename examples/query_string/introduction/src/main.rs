/// Holds data extracted from the Request query string.
///
/// When a query string extraction struct is configured for a route as part of `Router` creation
/// the `Router` will attempt to extract data from each matching request's query string and store
/// it in `state` ready for your application to use, ensuring that all type safety requirements have
/// been met by the request before handing back control.
///
/// The key requirements for struct to act as a query string extractor are:
///
///     1. That the struct implements the `serde::de::Deserialize` trait which we're doing here by
///        simply deriving it. The Gotham router uses this property during Request query string
///        evaluation to create and instance of your struct, populate it and store it into state
///        ready for access by application code.
///     2. That the struct implements `gotham::state::data::StateData` trait so that it can be
///        stored, retrieved and removed from state. You generally get this for free by deriving
///        `StateData` as shown here.
///     3. That the struct implements the
///        `gotham::router::response::extender::StaticResponseExtender` trait so that bad request
///        query string data can be appropriately refused by the Router. You generally get this
///        for free by deriving `StaticResponseExtender` as shown here which results in bad
///        requests being refuted with a HTTP 400 (BadRequest) response status code.
///
/// Naming of fields in extraction structs is important, the same names must appear in the
/// query string.
