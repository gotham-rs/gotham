# Gotham Examples

Standalone crates that act as examples for building web applications with Gotham.

All include test cases that demonstrate correct behaviour and serve as an example of
how to test your own applications.

These examples are best reviewed once you've understood the Rust language itself through resources
such as [the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/).
