# Gotham examples

Standalone crates that act as examples for building web applications with Gotham.

All include test cases that prove correctness and serve as an example of how to test your own applications.

These examples are best reviewed once you've understood the Rust language itself through resources
such as [the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/).
