# `Functionality` Examples

A collection of crates that provide examples of `functionality` when working
with the Gotham web framework.

> For specific areas of functionality a new directory under `examples` is
> created, using this README template as a basis to describe the provided
> examples.

## Ordering

We recommend reviewing our `functionality` examples in the order shown below:

1. [Name](name) - Shows how to do something with `functionality`

> Choose example names that describe functionality. The starting example being
> called "Introduction" is a pattern that other areas follow but is not
> a hard requirement.
>
> Do not use words like "simple", "basic", "intermediate" or "advanced" which 
> are subjective and may make the example seem unaccessible to some developers.
