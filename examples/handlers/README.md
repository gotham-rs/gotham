# Handler Examples

A collection of crates that provide examples of handlers, the primary building 
block of a Gotham web framework application.

A `Handler` is an asynchronous function, taking a `State` value which 
represents the request and related runtime state. It completes by resolving to 
a HTTP response.

Developers working with the Gotham web framework create handlers and via the
`Router` map them to individual routes. The `Router` then invokes the
appropriate `Handler` to process incoming requests.

## Ordering

We recommend reviewing our handler examples in the order shown below:

1. [Request Data](request_data) - Accessing common request information
1. [Stateful Handlers](stateful) - Keeping state in a handler
1. [Simple Async Handlers](simple_async_handlers) - Async Request Handlers 101
1. [Async Handlers](async_handlers) - More complicated async request handlers
