# Routing Examples

A collection of crates that provide examples of the Gotham web framework Router.

The `Router` dispatches `Requests` to a linked `Route` and handles error
responses when a valid `Route` is missing or an internal error state occurs.

## Ordering

We recommend reviewing our routing examples in the order shown below:

1. [Introduction](introduction) - Introduces fundamental router and router builder concepts.
1. [HTTP Verbs](http_verbs) - Shows how to route requests to handlers based on HTTP verbs.
1. [Scopes](scopes) - Combining routes under a common, nestable, root.
1. [Associations](associations) - Associate multiple handlers to a single path.
