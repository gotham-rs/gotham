# Path Examples

A collection of crates that provide examples of working with the request path and the Gotham web
framework.

## Ordering

We recommend reviewing our request path examples in the order shown below:

1. [Introduction](introduction) - Introduces having the Gotham web framework Router extract request
                                  path segments, in a type safe way, for use in your application.
2. [Glob matching](globs) - Shows how to match arbitrarily many path segments.
2. [Regex matching](regex) - Shows how to match against Regex patterns in path segments.
