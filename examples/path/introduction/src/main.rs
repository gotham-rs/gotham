/// Holds data extracted from the Request path.
///
/// When a path extraction struct is configured for a route as part of `Router` creation the `Router`
/// will attempt to extract data from each matching request path and store it in state ready for
/// your application to use, ensuring that all type safety requirements have been met by the request
/// before handing back control.
///
/// The key requirements for struct to act as a path extractor are:
///
///     1. That the struct implements `serde::de::Deserialize` which we're doing here by simply
///        deriving it. The Gotham router uses this property during Request path evaluation to
///        create and instance of your struct, populate it and store it into state ready for
///        access by application code.
///     2. That the struct implements `gotham::state::data::StateData` so that it can be stored,
///        retrieved and removed from state. You generally get this for free by deriving
///        `StateData` as shown here.
///     3. That the struct implements the
///        `gotham::router::response::extender::StaticResponseExtender` trait so that bad request
///        path data can be appropriately refused by the Router. You generally get this for free by
///        deriving `StaticResponseExtender` as shown here which results in bad requests being
///        refuted with a HTTP 400 (BadRequest) response status code.
///
/// Naming of fields in extraction structs is important, the same names must appear in the path,
/// proceeded by a colon to indicate a variable, when defining routes.
